## About

Import Kindle Clippings and show them in accessible way. The app divides clippings into books and gives an option to delete and like highlights.

## What I Have Learned

This project was more goal oriented rather than education oriented. I wanted to have a simple desktop application (electron) for managing my kindle clippings.

## Development

1. Install dependencies with `npm install`.
1. Run desktop application with `npm run start` or react app with `npm run react-start`.
1. Access application under `localhost:3000`.

## Deployment
